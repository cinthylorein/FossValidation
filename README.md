# FossValidation

'FossValidation' is a Java package for the BEAST2 platform that provides tools for assessing the consistency of fossil calibration points in molecular clock studies. The package implements the statistical methods proposed by Near (2005) and allows for cross-validation analysis of multiple fossil calibrations in a phylogeny.
